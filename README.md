# SysId: System Identification for Robot Mechanisms

This is the C++ version of [frc-characterization](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/frc-characterization). It uses the [wpimath](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpimath) backend for generating feedforward and feedback gains.

## Building and Running SysId

SysId uses Gradle to build. To build debug and release versions of the main executable and run tests, run `./gradlew build`. During development, you can use `./gradlew run` to build and run the debug executable.
